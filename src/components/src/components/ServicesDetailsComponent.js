                                <p>A mulch is usually but not exclusively organic in nature. It may be permanent (e.g. plastic sheeting) or temporary (e.g. bark chips). It may be applied to bare soil, or around existing plants. Mulches of manure or compost will be incorporated naturally into the soil by the activity of worms and other organisms.</p>

                                <p>Moss thrives in Ireland’s climate and is often increased from poor mowing techniques. Our process to rectify this problem is to firstly survey the infected area in order to determine the extent of the problem. This is usually followed up by applying a moss control preventive formula to the area.</p>
                                <p>We then leave the infected area for 2-3 weeks where we would return to scarify the lawn. This method helps to remove the now dead moss where it is collected and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner.</p>

                                <p>Remaining bare patches are then further repaired using good quality selected seed, and we then further follow up by using our specialised fertiliser treatment to really get your lawn thriving again. Most of our clients see an improvement within 6-8 weeks.</p>

                                <p>The process of over seeding and aeration can work wonders to rejuvenate tired lawns. We would normally begin the process by firstly surveying the area, this is done to gauge the quantity of seed that is required for the process. This is then followed up by the process of aerating the soil. Aeration can relieve compacted soil and allow the soil to benefit from increased oxygen which in turn strengthens the root system of your lawn.</p>

                                <p>Then next process is the dispersal of seed or ‘overseeding’ Garden Help only use the best selected seed which is stronger than the existing lawn turf and best suited to out compete annual lawn weeds.</p>
